# XStudio MiNi

Small version of what used to be the vision for the future of mods before [cometSPARK](https://github.com/projectcomet64/SPARK) came along.

It is uploaded now to serve as a moderately simple M64MM3 addon that's not just a "hello world". Its original purpose is no longer relevant to the machinima community nowadays.

# Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022
- M64MM3's repository in a folder called M64MM outside of where this repository is.
  - Example: if the .sln for XStudio Mini is in ``C:/projects/XSM/XStudioMini.sln``, the whole M64MM3 repo must be in ``C:/projects/M64MM``.
